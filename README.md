# [MAP-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09757)

PyTorch implementation of **MAP-Net**, from the following paper:

[Video Dehazing via a Multi-Range Temporal Alignment Network with Physical Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09757). CVPR 2023.\

We propose **MAP-Net**, a novel video dehazing framework that effectively explores the physical haze priors and aggregates temporal information.


## Dataset

<p align="center">
<img src="./docs/image/haze_world.jpg"
     class="center">
</p>

We construct a large-scale outdoor video dehazing benchmark dataset, **HazeWorld**, which contains video frames in various real-world scenarios.

To prepare the HazeWorld dataset for experiments, please follow the [instructions](./docs/dataset_prepare.md).


## Installation

This implementation is based on [MMEditing](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting),
which is an open-source image and video editing toolbox.

```
python 3.10.9
pytorch 1.12.1
torchvision 0.13.1
cuda 11.3
```

Below are quick steps for installation.

**Step 1.**
Install PyTorch following [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

**Step 2.**
Install MMCV with [MIM](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim).

```shell
pip3 install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
```

**Step 3.**
Install MAP-Net from source.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jiaqixuac/MAP-Net.git
cd MAP-Net
pip3 install -e .
```

Please refer to [MMEditing Installation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting/blob/master/docs/en/install.md) for more detailed instruction.


## Getting Started

You can train MAP-Net on HazeWorld using the below command with 4 GPUs:

```shell
bash tools/dist_train.sh configs/dehazers/mapnet/mapnet_hazeworld.py 4
```


## Evaluation

We mainly use [psnr and ssim](./mmedit/core/evaluation/metrics.py) to measure the model performance.
For HazeWorld, we compute the dataset-averaged video-level metrics;
see the [*evaluate*](./mmedit/datasets/hw_folder_multiple_gt_dataset.py) function.

You can use the following command with 1 GPU to test your trained model `xxx.pth`:

```shell
bash tools/dist_test.sh configs/dehazers/mapnet/mapnet_hazeworld.py xxx.pth 1
```

You can find one model checkpoint trained on HazeWorld [here](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jqxu/models/MAP-Net/mapnet_hazeworld_40k.pth) or [here](https://huggingface.co/jiaqixuac/MAP-Net/blob/main/mapnet_hazeworld_40k.pth).


## Results

Demo for the real-world hazy videos.
